# Cockroach Icons

## How does this package work?

This package serves as a store for SVG icons that are converted and published as React components. The SVGs are stored in the [/svg](https://github.com/cockroachdb/ui/tree/master/packages/icons/svg) directory and [@svgr/cli](https://react-svgr.com/docs/cli/) is used to convert them to React components in TypeScript.

Since the components are generated from `.svg` files they are not committed in this repository. The only file that is kept under source control is the [index.ts](https://github.com/cockroachdb/ui/blob/master/packages/icons/src/index.ts). The components are generated to the directory `src/components` by the npm script [`build:generate`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/ui/blob/master/packages/icons/package.json). Once the components are generated, they are transpiled and TypeScript declarations are generated by the [TypeScript Compiler](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) (npm script [`build:typescript`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/ui/blob/master/packages/icons/package.json)). 

To generate the files locally run `npm run build` or `yarn run build`.

## Historic reference

Our first pass at this used SVGR as a webpack plugin, [@svgr/webpack](https://react-svgr.com/docs/webpack/). While this worked fine for generating the code it made it difficult to work with in TypeScript. The first issue was that the `index.ts` file would export `.svg` files. For example,

```js
export { default as ArrowLeft } from "../svg/arrow-left.svg";
export { default as Aws } from "../svg/aws.svg";
export { default as Backup } from "../svg/backup.svg";
export { default as CancelCircleFilled } from "../svg/cancel-circle-filled.svg";
export { default as CancelCircle } from "../svg/cancel-circle.svg";
// etc etc
```

This vexed TypeScript as it could not process the module `arrow-left.svg` without a little help. This was alleviated by setting up [module declaration for svg assets](https://duncanleung.com/typescript-module-declearation-svg-img-assets/). Something like,

`./src/@types/assets/index.d.ts`
```ts
declare module "\*.svg" {
  import { FunctionComponent, SVGProps } from "react";
  export const ReactComponent: FunctionComponent<SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>>;
  const src: string;
  export default src;
}
```

`./tsconfig.json`
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "typeRoots": ["./src/@types", "./node_module/@types"],
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

This resolved the first issue (that the svg imports would fail type checking), but the second issue was how to export declarations for the components bundled by Webpack. This would lead to removing Webpack entirely as it was far too heavy a tool to simply generate React Components.

I'm leaving this here as a learning because I think this technique would be useful in an application where lots of bundling is happening for React Components and preprocessed CSS. Dropping in the `@svgr/webpack` plugin and adding the module declaration to an existing declarations file would be trivial and could result in an effective way to handle svg icons.
