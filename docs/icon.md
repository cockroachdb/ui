# Icon

Icons are visual representations of commands, objects, or common actions and are used to provide visual context and enhance usability. They should be simple, yet bold enough to grab attention. Icons should be used in a purposeful manner to maximize comprehension and reduce cognitive load when you need to call attention to a particular action, command, or section. Use them infrequently – if you’re questioning an icon’s use, it probably doesn’t need to be used at all.
<br/><br/>

## System icons
Used as visual representations of common actions and commands to provide additional context and enhance usability. These icons can be scaled up or down in size if necessary. They should only be used as 1 color. Icons should follow the same WCAG 2.0 standard as typography.

## Pictogram icons
Pictogram icons contain more than 1 color value and are larger in size than system icons. They are used to add personality, visual interest and branding into the UI where space is available.

## Illustrations
Illustrations are used at a large scale, typically in areas with a lot of space like empty states or 404 pages. They add personality, visual interest and branding into the UI.

## Formatting

### Icon spacing
Adequate space should surround icons to allow legibility. Icons should have padding of at least 8px around them. For example, icons within icon-only buttons have padding of 12px.
<br/><br/>

### Icon alignment
If used alongside text, icons should be vertically center aligned with the text.
