# Docs

This directory holds docs about design system components and the published packages in this repository.

## Design system guidelines
The design system docs provide guidance around how to use UI components (style, behavior, formatting, etc). 

These docs accompany the [Figma Design System file](https://www.figma.com/file/B5AtEGdRbW3VxiBdg62TB8Xw/CRDB-Design-System?node-id=0%3A1), which Product Designers use to design user interfaces.
