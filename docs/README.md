# Docs

This directory holds docs about shared frontend resources and frontend

## Design system guidelines

The design system docs provide guidance around how to use UI
components (style, behavior, formatting, etc).

These docs accompany the [Figma Design System file](https://www.figma.com/file/B5AtEGdRbW3VxiBdg62TB8Xw/CRDB-Design-System?node-id=0%3A1),
which Product Designers use to design user interfaces.
